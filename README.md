## 🎯 Course Description

Software Engineering is more than the programming phase of an application arena. Phases of the software engineering life cycle include specialised processes and tools to ensure that real-world projects, both large and small, are delivered in a quality manner under financial constraints using processes and tools. This course aims to develop knowledge of the processes and associated tools required to service the software development life cycle.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Utilize** various software engineering processes and their tools as required for best-practice development of software systems
2. **Identify, analyse, compare and contrast** different processes and their assistive tools for selected phases of the software engineering life cycle
3. **Cooperate and contribute** to a team environment, develop team dynamics, work according to an agreed team protocol, and resolve/manage conflict issues
4. **Run and document** meetings
5. **Plan, identify and apply** processes, standards and tools for phases of a software engineering life cycle for a substantial software development project
6. **Clearly present and discuss** the developed solutions with a variety of audiences
